# big_data_processing_taxi_drivers

Master's Degree in Big Data analysis and engeneering. Assignment 2 of the Systems for Big Data Processing course.

You are asked to use Apache Hive to create indexes for answering the following queries:

    1. What are the 10 most frequent routes (pickup-area, dropoff-area), given a weekday (0=sun, 6=sat) and
    hour (no minutes)?
    2. What is the expected duration and distance of a taxi ride, given the pickup area, the weekday (0=sun,
    6=sat) and time? Consider time intervals of 15 minutes.
    3. What is the factor of additional clients when it is raining or snowing (merge these conditions into one)
    versus dry weather, given the pickup-area?
    4. An optional 4 th index that will answer a non-trivial and interesting question over the given data
    set. If you add this to your project you will get some extra points.
